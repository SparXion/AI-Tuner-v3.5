AI Tuner removes the mystery from every chatbot.

No more guessing why an AI answers the way it does. No more fighting hidden defaults. With one tap you see exactly how the AI is wired — and with one drag you change it.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Pick any AI
Choose from Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, or Llama. Each model has its own default personality that you can see visualized instantly.

2. See inside its mind
A live radar chart instantly shows the AI's current personality — empathy, bluntness, creativity, speed, truth-focus… everything is visible and tunable.

3. Tune it your way
• New users: Tap a persona (Therapist, Coder, Researcher, Friend, Scam Hunter…) and the AI changes instantly.
• Power users: Drag any of the 26 axes on the radar chart for total control.
• Everyone: Watch the radar spin and the prompt update in real time.
