## Introduction

AI Tuner ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application ("App").

All app functionality operates entirely on your device. We do not:

## Local Storage

The App uses local storage (iOS UserDefaults) to save:
- Your app preferences (e.g., tutorial completion status)
- Saved presets and configurations
- Selected models and personas

This data is stored exclusively on your device and never leaves your device. You can delete this data at any time by deleting the App.

## Third-Party Services

AI Tuner does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data collection services.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, and since we don't collect any information, this is not applicable.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no data security concerns. All local data stored on your device is protected by iOS security features.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there's no data to access, modify, or delete. You maintain full control over any local data stored by the App.
